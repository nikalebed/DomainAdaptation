This repository contains an implementation of a novel domain-adaptation method in the core folder. The method is inspired by [Difa](https://github.com/YBYBZhang/DiFa/tree/master) and [HyperDomainNet](https://github.com/MACderRu/HyperDomainNet/tree/main).

You can explore the pipeline in the colab notebook.
